# doc-viewer
This project is a web application that allows users to view documents and add annotations to them. 

It provides a user-friendly interface for navigating through the document, zooming in and out, and adding various types of annotations such as pictures or inscriptions to any page. 

The application also allows users to move and delete annotations as needed.
## Features
- Document Viewing: Users can open a document by clicking on a provided link that contains the document's ID. The document is downloaded from a json file and displayed to the user. The application supports pagination and scrolling to ensure smooth navigation through the document.
- Zooming: Users have the ability to zoom in and out of the document for better readability. The zoom feature allows users to adjust the document's size according to their preferences.
- Annotations: Users can add annotations to any page of the document. Annotations can be in the form of pictures or inscriptions. Once added, annotations can be moved or deleted by the user.
- Saving Annotations: The application provides a "Save" button that allows users to save their annotations. In this project, for the sake of time, the result is output to the console instead of creating a new page.
